# Mongo Social API
## Description

Mongo Social is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. This API uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, moment.js is used to format timestamps.
